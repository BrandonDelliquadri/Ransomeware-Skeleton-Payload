# Ransomeware Skeleton Payload
This short project is a prelude to a more complete ransomeware I plan to develop in the future. This code, based on NetworkChuck's ransomeware, is a basic and non-practical example of how ransomeware encrypts a device's files. 

I plan to create a portable and practical version of this closer to what would be seen in an actual ransomeware attack solely for educational reasons for my next project.

WARNING: This program will get flagged and quarantined by Windows Security.
